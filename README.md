<p> This project is about a twitter's account named as <a href="https://twitter.com/dog_rates">WeRateDogs</a>. WeRateDogs is an account that classify people's dog with a really funny comment. It was born in 2015, by a college student, Matt Nelson, that received an international attention. </p>
<p> By October 2017 it had an additional 3.7 million followers. These classifications almost always have a denominator of 10. But what about numerators? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Because? Because "they're good dogs, Brent." </p>
